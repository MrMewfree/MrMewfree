* 👋 Hi, I’m @MrMrewfree
* 👀 I’m interested in putting a DJ in everyone's pocket, always available and for all occasions of life
* 🌱 I’m currently learning. Slowly but surely. 
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with whoever wants to build the future of musical curation. 
* 📫 How to reach me: bonjou@mercutio.app
* 😄 Pronouns: He/him/that
* ⚡ Fun fact: I like hugs, kisses and slipknot. I hate pasta that sticks to the pan, napping under a pine tree and my neighbor. I want to create a business that generates a lot of cash that can be reinvested in a village of arts, free for everyone.
